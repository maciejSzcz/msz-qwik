# Welcome to My Blog

Hello and welcome! I have no idea how you found this blog, but as you are already here, let me introduce myself.

My name is Maciej SzczÄ™sny and I'm a software developer from Poland. I've been working as a frontend dev since 2021.

I plan to write about anything I find interesting regarding programming, AI and any other thing.

I also like cars, motorbikes, jetskis and anything fast with an engine.

Keep tight, my first article is coming soon! (I have no idea when though)
